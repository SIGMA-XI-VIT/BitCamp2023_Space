   <h1>Climate Change </h1> 
     <p> <i>Climate change </i>In India, exposure to heat waves is said to increase by 8 times between 2021 and 2050, and by 300% by the end of this century. The number of Indians exposed to heat waves increased by 200% from 2010 to 2016.
    Around seven million people are projected to be displaced due to, among other factors, submersion of parts of Mumbai and Chennai, if global temperatures were to rise by 2 °C (3.6 °F).<br> </p> <br>

   <h1>Conservation</h1>
<p> Conservation in India can be traced to the time of Ashoka, tracing to the Ashoka Pillar Edicts as one of the earliest conservation efforts in the world. Conservation generally refers to the act of carefully and efficiently using natural resources. Conservation efforts begun in India before 5 AD, as efforts are made to have a forest administration. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is the ministry responsible for implementation of environmental and forestry program in India, which include the management of national parks, conservation of flora and fauna of India, and pollution controls. <br> </p><br>

   <h1>Change Detection</h1>
<p> The present study was conducted in Rani Khola watershed located in the East District of Sikkim State, India (Fig. 1). The watershed lies between 27°13′9N to 27°23′51 N and 88°29′31E to 88°43′18E with an area approximately 254 km2. Elevational range of watershed varies from 300 to 4100 m from mean sea level at the extreme north. Geology of the watershed is characterized by Gorubathan Formation, Chungthang Formation (Paro), Lingtse Granite Gneiss rock formations. More than 50% of the area is made up of the rocks belonging to Gorubathan Formation and concentrated in the central and western part of the watershed (GSI, 2006). 
    Rani Khola is one of the major tributaries of Teesta River and is also known as Rongni Chu in local dialect. Rani Khola watershed is one of the very prominent watersheds of Teesta basin and it is characterised by variety of landforms. Most of the area in this watershed falls in high mountain region with very steep slopes, the average angle being 30°–40°. North-east region is mainly characterized by moraines and exposed rocks. Vegetation in this area consists of dense forests, open forest and alpine scrubs. Reserved forests namely Martam Reserved Forest, Bhusuk Reserved Forest and Assam Reserved Forest enrich the floral diversity of the study area.  <br> </p> <br>

   <h1>Natural Disasters</h1>
 <p>Geological disaster<br>
    Changes in the above or underneath the earth's surface cause geological disasters. The effects of natural disasters due to tectonic plates are unpredictable and beyond human control. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, avalanches, etc., are examples of geological disasters.<br><br>
    
    Hydrological disaster<br>
    Hydrological disasters are caused due to sudden changes in the quality or distribution of water below the earth’s surface or atmospheric conditions. Flood and drought both fall under hydrological disasters. These disasters can cause harm to agriculture and properties. Limnic eruption, Tsunami, Volcano, etc., are examples of Hydrological disasters.<br><br>
    
    Meteorological disaster<br>
    Meteorological disasters are mainly caused by extreme weather conditions such as drought, snow, and rain. These disasters affect the weather forming process and atmospheric conditions. Examples of meteorological disasters include blizzards, drought, cold waves, tornadoes, cyclonic storms, etc.<br><br>
    
    Space disaster<br>
    This includes disasters caused due to asteroids, meteors, and solar flares.<br><br>
    
    Wildfires<br>
    Natural disasters like drought and lightning can lead to wildfires. However, many humans also start fires in forests to create space for agricultural land.<br><br>
    
    Now let’s check what causes natural disasters. This will help you in implementing the needed disaster management techniques. <br> </p> <br>

        Fatalities- Around 5.85 crore<br>
        Starting in 1876 in south and south-western India in Bombay (presently Mumbai) and Madras (presently Chennai), the Great Famine was an after-effect of severe drought.
